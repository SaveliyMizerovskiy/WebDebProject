        <p>Currently all of my photos are from Brooklyn NY, but I hope to get photos from other places when I have time</p>
        <p>Brooklyn is a pretty good place to take picturesfor now since it has a lot of nature but i really want to take some pictures of Manhatten becuase it would be neat to have the contrast between the tall building of the borough and the nature close to it</p>
